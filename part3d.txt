Q2:
    Since the String is immutable, String cannot be appended, instead it creates and
  return a new object for each change, which takes a lot of time when dealing with long
  Strings.
    While on the other hand StringBuilder is mutable because StringBuilder contains an
  internal char array. So when appending, StringBuilder changes the char array in it.
    Doesn't like a String, StringBuilder doesn't return a new String every time it is
  changed, therefore StringBuilder is much faster when dealing with long Strings.
